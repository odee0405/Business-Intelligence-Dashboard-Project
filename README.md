# Business-Intelligence-Dashboard-Project

## Project Description
In this exciting project, we have been entrusted by GetINNOtized with the task of crafting and delivering a comprehensive end-to-end business intelligence solution. Our client has diligently amassed a wealth of transactional data throughout 2019, yet has yet to unlock its full potential. They have reached out to us in the hopes that our expertise will make sense of this data, enabling us to construct a well-tailored report that not only analyzes the information at hand but also unearths invaluable opportunities for increased sales and enhanced operational efficiency. Together, we embark on a journey of discovery, where data becomes the compass guiding our path to success.
